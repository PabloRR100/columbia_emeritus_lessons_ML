## Question 1 - Building Cluster Assignment Algorithms

For the point ii; set cluster indicator cici to be the kk according to the equation 
ci=argmink ||xiâˆ’Î¼k||2ci=argmink ||xiâˆ’Î¼k||2, where kk is one of the clusters.

e.g. The point ii is in the cluster with the center nearest to the point.

Code a function called assign_clusters_k_means Accept two arguments:

    points: a 2-d numpy array of the locations of each point
    clusters: a 2-d numpy array of the locations of the centroid of each cluster.
    Determine which cluster centroid is closest to each point.

RETURN a 2-d numpy array where each row indicates which cluster a point is closets to, and thus also assigned to:

e.g. [0,1,0,...,0] indicates the point is assigned to the second cluster, and
[0,0,...,1] indicates the point is assigned to the last cluster
